                        I am a Graphic Designer and Web Developer from Tunisia,
                        living in Copenhagen Danmark. I have studied IT &
                        Multimedia in Tunisia and have gained a lot of practical
                        experience in Photography, Graphic Design, and Web
                        Design. This experience I have gained through different
                        jobs working for a political candidate’s campaign and
                        later doing media work for them as member of the
                        Tunisian parliament. I have also worked for a Tunisian
                        magazine creating graphics and page layout.
